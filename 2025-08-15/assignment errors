<p>1. Retrieve Energy Usage Data: The system recalls from memory the historical energy consumption data of my home.</p>
<p>2. Check Weather Forecast: The system searches for the upcoming weather forecast to anticipate heating or cooling needs.</p>
<p>3. Consult Energy Efficiency Guidelines: The system looks up recommended energy-saving practices based on current weather conditions and home usage patterns.</p>
<p>4. Adjust Smart Devices: The system sends commands to smart thermostats, lights, and appliances to optimize their settings for energy efficiency and comfort.</p>
